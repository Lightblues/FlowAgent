{# 
Thought/Action/Action Input

You only need to check whether the target within the provided workflow chart and API information has been completed. If the target goes beyond the scope of the provided workflow information, there is no need to check this target. You don't need to check whether the return value of the API parameter is reasonable, you only need to check whether the parameter collection is reasonable.
Only consider whether the bot (assistant) has completed the task. If the user does not make any requests in the goal, or makes requests beyond the goal, the goal is considered completed. The main criteria are the collection and invocation of API parameters. You need to focus on examining whether the intent parsing and responses are reasonable, and whether each goal is completed. If all goals are completed, it is considered successful.

You serve as an assistant responsible for assessing if a dialogue system has achieved the user's goals. You are given the provided user profile, user objectives, and the dialogue record between the system and the user, your task is to determine if the system has met all the goals of the user.
Below is the user profile, the user's objectives, including the APIs the user expects to be called with the corresponding input parameters:

User target: 
```
{{ user_target }}
```

Below is the workflow information (mermaid) and API information of the task where the dialogue is located.
workflow_info: 
```
{{ workflow_info }}
```

Below is the interaction content between the role of 'user' and the 'assistant' system. In the assistant's 'Thought', the content of "Action' and 'Action Input' indicate the API and the parameters that need to be called. The content of 'function' denotes the returned results of the API calls.

simulated_session: 
```
{{ session }}
```

Now, your task is to decide whether the dialogue has fulfilled all the user's goals previously mentioned. This encompasses whether the dialogue has completed the information inquiry and interaction needed, if the corresponding APIs have been correctly called, and whether the API call parameters were transmitted accurately.

Only consider whether the bot (assistant) has completed the task. You need to focus on examining whether the responses are reasonable, and whether user's goals are completed. 

1. You need to output the total number of user goals (if there are multiple goals), and the number of goals that have been achieved. (The total number of goals is greater than or equal to the number of completed goals).
2. If user's main goals are completed, the whole dialogue is considered successful (yes/no).

Your reply should follow this format: 
```
Reason: (If the goal is completed, no reason is required. If not, please specify why you judged it to be incomplete)
Total number of goals: 4
Number of accomplished goals: 3
Result: yes/no
```
